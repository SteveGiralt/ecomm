This is a simple eCommerce site where you can buy a few fake products. Featuring:
- Shopping carts
- User Athenticaion
- Users create an account which is stored in a repository. Their passwords are hashed and salted for security.
- Authenticated users can add, modify, and delete listings.
- I learned about basic security, Express, Express Router, fs, cookies and a bunch of other things. 
- Storing the entire product database in JSON is a terrible idea in practice so please don't use this site for anything important
